# System Communication Protocol Manual

## 1. Functional Overview
This manual defines every proprietary serial command sentence used across the UNIVAC Replacement Bridge Matrix system architecture. All communications on the maritime data bus use ASCII-encoded text strings based on industrial NMEA-0183 syntax rules.

To guarantee hard-deterministic execution profiles, all packets must be transmitted as binary ASCII byte frames terminated with a strict carriage return and line feed line terminator sequence (\r\n). 

## 2. Universal Frame Syntax Structures
Every outbound and inbound proprietary command string must adhere to the following structural framing schema:

$[Prefix],[Data_1],[Data_2],...,[Data_N]*[Checksum]\r\n

1. $ (Hex 0x24): The mandatory start-of-sentence framing character.
2. P (Hex 0x50): Proprietary address indicator token.
3. [Prefix]: 6-character identifier mapping the device source and sentence content type.
4. , (Hex 0x2C): Data field delimiter character.
5. *[Checksum]: 8-bit exclusive OR (XOR) hexadecimal verification tag.
6. \r\n (Hex 0x0D, 0x0A): End-of-line carriage return and line feed.

### 8-Bit XOR Checksum Reference Formula
The validation checksum is calculated by performing an XOR operation on the ASCII values of all characters situated between the leading $ and trailing * delimiters:

Checksum = XOR sum of ord(char) for all characters in the payload body.
